### Special thanks to Kenji

He gave me the idea to to use borders to create my timeline
and then on larger screens to swap to a grid layout
instead of using position absolute/relative.

Without that insight I was ready to abandon the timeline idea.


### Special thanks to Shawna Ray (dyewind)

She provided the amazing illustrations and helped immensely when it came time to
choosing color shades. Her input and influence is felt throughout the design.


### Special thanks to Adamn Wathan and the Tailwind Project

After reading their book Refactoring UI, I use their font / spacing
scales in every design. That alone fixed 80% of my design problems.
