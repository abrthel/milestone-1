  <title>Aaron Barthel - Full Stack Software Developer</title>

  <!--
    Notice:

    Typically I would use a tool such as PostCSS to minify the following
    CSS/JS files into proper packages. However the goal of this
    project is to confirm I am able to write well-formed CSS/JS and therefore
    I am choosing to break out my structures into seperate files for clarity.
