  <!--
    Notice:

    Typically I would use a tools such as PostCSS and a JS Minifier to minify the following
    CSS/JS files into proper packages. However the goal of this
    project is to confirm I am able to write well-formed CSS/JS and therefore
    I am choosing to break out my structures into seperate files for clarity.

    </header>

    <p>
      I am a full-stack software developer based in Edmonton, Alberta.
      I craft stylish applications for the modern web.
    </p>

    <p>
      Originally I come from the overdimensional transportation industry where
      I managed the logistics of moving large buildings down public roads.
      While producing route surveys and transport plans I developed a knack for
      intricate processes and further honed my eye for detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I am transitioning into software development through an intensive
      boot-camp ran by instructors from the University of Alberta.
